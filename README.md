# About
--------------

This is a location that contains scripts for processing certain repetitive tasks.  It is inspired by a project to mint a custom NFT
but, it will likely come in handy for a variety of other tasks in the future.

# Project Plan
--------------
  - [x] Create a script for copying the files and incrementing the number (ie. file name: 0.json is copied and creates 1.json)
  - [x] Create a script for opening a file and incrementing the token ID number (ie. token number: 0 is now token number: 1)
  - [ ] Nest the scripts inside one another so that as the new incremental file is created, the token is incremented
  - [ ] Create a script that copies image files in binary and increments the file number (as above)

These files have been created through learning related to concepts like "first-order functions", "file read-write-replace", and a 
variety of code concepts around meta data files.  Some possible places to dig around are included below.
